On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
The purpose of HTML is to structure web pages

What is the difference between an element and a tag?
An element is used to describe the structure of pages a tag is like a container and they tell you something about the information between the opening and closing tags

Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element, they appear at the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts; a name and a value separated by an equals sign

Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
The <head> element's content is not displayed on the page. Instead, the head's job is to contain metadata about the document.
The HTML <title> element defines the title of the document, shown in a browser's title bar or on the page's tab. It can only contain text
  The body element may be the most important HTML element there is. The contents of the <body> element are what actually get displayed to the user visiting your web page or viewing your document. And yet, it is very simple. The < body> must be a direct child of <html> , it must come after <head> (if <head> is present.

In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
You right click to get to "show page source".

List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <p></p> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
<h1></h1> h1 represents the largest heading

<head></head> represents 'header', non-displaying information about the document, like the TITLE and other descriptive tags.

<title></title> this represents the Title that appears in the Browser header and on bookmark lists. Should be concise and meaningful.

<body></body> this represents the content that appears on the web page.

<a href="url"<a>  Allows the user to retrieve the document at the specified URL by clicking on the contents of the element. (Usually displayed as blue and underlined.) The URL may include a named target.



What are empty elements?
Empty elements have no content <br> ia an empty element which doesn't require a closing tag

What is semantic markup? 
Semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph.
